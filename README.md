# Human-sentiment-Analysis-using-AI-techniques
Nowadays, we know that E-Commerce Business is one of the trending businesses around the world. And they ran their business through various websites in which they want large number of feedbacks and reviews from customers on their products. We know, it is obviously quite hard to analyse how many customers give positive reviews and how many give negative reviews. In normal day scenario, we never be able to analyse these reviews. So, there is a need to adopt sentiment analysis in the picture.
SENTIMENT ANALYIS is the process of detecting positive or negative sentiments in text. It’s often used by businesses to detect sentiment in social data and understand customers. Hence, it helps to determine the ratio of positive to negative engagements about a specific topic. You can analyse bodies of text such as comments, tweets, and product reviews to obtain insights from your audience.
In this project, creating a web-based UI DASHBOARD to gain real time analysis on how customers feel about Client’s products using MACHINE LEARNING and NLP Techniques with Data processing on Large Dataset. 


# NLP (Natural Language Processing):- 
Natural Language Processing is the process of making system understandable in Human Language. It is used to convert text data into numerical data, also known as Vectorization (FEATURE EXTRACTION) and it is compulsory for a model to get be numerical data. In NLP world, every individual review is called as “document”.

# BAD OF WORDS MODEL: -
This model creates a dictionary for each word by finding unique words present in a document dataframe. It creates a sparse matrix for each word having majority of ‘0’ entry columns.Class ‘CountVectorizer’ from scikit-learn perform the conversion from text data to sparse matrix (numeric data).

# TF-IDF VECTORIZER: - 
TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency Vectorizer, which finds importance of each word (whether a word is relevant or important in the numerical representation of a document). TF-IDF makes a score of a word. Higher the score, more of the relevant words in a document.

LOGISTIC REGRESSION: - Logistic Regression is one of the best algorithms performed on text data (classification problem). It is a probability-based model.
